# CS-330
This project helped me understand 3D rendering and the complex process that makes a simple still-life scene. I have learned a lot working with opengl while also improving my knowledge of C++ and VisualStudio -- all of which will contribute to more expertly executed future products. This project also showed me that modularization not only provides cleaner, easier to navigate code -- but it can also provide a better environment for experimentation. When the program is modular, adding/adjusting/deleting code doesn't cause the entire program to break. For all these reasons, CS-330 has given me a lot of tools to implement in future classes and in my career. It is a difficult but highly valuable course.
